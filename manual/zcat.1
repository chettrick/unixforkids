.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm compress
.Op Fl cfrv
.Op Ar
.Nm uncompress
.Op Fl cfrv
.Op Ar
.Nm zcat
.Op Fl fr
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
reduces the size of the named files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding,
in compress mode.
Each file is renamed to the same name plus the extension
.Dq .Z .
As many of the modification time, access time, file flags, file mode,
user ID, and group ID as allowed by permissions are retained in the
new file.
If compression would not reduce the size of a file,
the file is ignored (unless
.Fl f
is used).
.Pp
The
.Nm uncompress
utility restores compressed files to their original form, renaming the
files by removing the extension.
It has the ability to restore files compressed by both
.Nm
and
.Xr gzip 1 ,
recognising the following extensions:
.Dq .Z ,
.Dq -Z ,
.Dq _Z ,
.Dq .gz ,
.Dq -gz ,
.Dq _gz ,
.Dq .tgz ,
.Dq -tgz ,
.Dq _tgz ,
.Dq .taz ,
.Dq -taz ,
and
.Dq _taz .
Extensions ending in
.Dq tgz
and
.Dq taz
are not removed when decompressing, instead they are converted to
.Dq tar .
.Pp
The
.Nm zcat
command is equivalent in functionality to
.Nm uncompress
.Fl c .
.Pp
If renaming the files would cause files to be overwritten and the standard
input device is a terminal, the user is prompted (on the standard error
output) for confirmation.
If prompting is not possible or confirmation is not received, the files
are not overwritten.
.Pp
If no files are specified, the standard input is compressed or uncompressed
to the standard output.
If either the input or output files are not regular files, the checks for
reduction in size and file overwriting are not performed, the input file is
not removed, and the attributes of the input file are not retained.
.Pp
The uncompressed file inherits the time stamp of the
compressed version and the uncompressed file name is generated from
the name of the compressed file as described above.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Compressed or uncompressed output is written to the standard output.
No files are modified (force
.Nm zcat
mode).
.It Fl f
Force compression of
.Ar file ,
even if it is not actually reduced in size.
Additionally, files are overwritten without prompting for confirmation.
If the input data is not in a format recognized by
.Nm
and if the option
.Fl c
is also given, copy the input data without change
to the standard output: let
.Nm zcat
behave as
.Xr cat 1 .
.It Fl r
Descend into specified directories recursively.
.It Fl v
Print the percentage reduction of each file and other information.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
uses a modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm
.Pq LZW .
Common substrings in the file are first replaced by 9-bit codes 257 and up.
When code 512 is reached, the algorithm switches to 10-bit codes and
continues to use more bits until the limit of 16-bit codes is reached.
.Pp
After the limit is reached,
.Nm
periodically checks the compression ratio.
If it is increasing,
.Nm
continues to use the existing code dictionary.
However, if the compression ratio decreases,
.Nm
discards the table of substrings and rebuilds it from scratch.
This allows the algorithm to adapt to the next
.Dq block
of the file.
.Pp
The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input
and the distribution of common substrings.
Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by 50 \- 60% using
.Nm .
Compression is generally much better than that achieved by Huffman
coding, or adaptive Huffman coding, and takes less time to compute.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm compress
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It 0
Success.
.It 1
An error occurred.
.It 2
At least one of the specified files was not compressed since
.Fl f
was not specified and compression would have resulted in a size
increase.
.It \*(Gt2
An error occurred.
