.Sh NAME
.Nm more
.Nd view files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm more
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl p Ar command
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
pager displays text one screenful at a time.
After showing each screenful, it prompts the user for a command.
Most commands scroll the text or move to a different place
in the file, while some switch to another file.
If no
.Ar file
is specified, or if
.Ar file
is a single dash
.Pq Ql - ,
the standard input is used.
.Pp
When showing the last line of a file,
.Nm
displays a prompt indicating end of file and the name of the next file
to examine, if any.
It then waits for input from the user.
Scrolling forward switches to the next file,
or exits if there is none.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Ignore case.
Upper and lower case are considered identical.
.It Fl n Ar number
Page
.Ar number
of lines per screenful.
By default,
.Nm
uses the terminal window size.
.It Fl p Ar command
Execute the specified
.Nm
commands when a file is first examined (or re-examined, such as with the
.Ic :e
or
.Ic :p
commands).
Multiple commands have to be concatenated into one single argument.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
Interactive commands for
.Nm
are based on
.Xr vi  1  .
Some commands may be preceded by a decimal number, called N in the
descriptions below.
In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic h
Help. Display a summary of these commands.
.It Ic f | ^F | SPACE
Scroll forward N lines, default one window.
.It Ic b | ^B
Scroll backward N lines, default one window.
.It Ic d | ^D
Scroll forward N lines, default one half of screen size.
.It Ic u | ^U
Scroll backward N lines, default one half of screen size.
.It Ic j | RETURN
Scroll forward N lines, default 1.
.It Ic k
Scroll backward N lines, default 1.
.It Ic g
Go to line N in the file, default 1 (beginning of file).
.It Ic G
Go to line N in the file, default the end of the file.
.It Ic m
Followed by any lowercase letter,
marks the current position with that letter.
.It Ic '
(Single quote.)
Followed by any lowercase letter, returns to the position which
was previously marked with that letter.
.It Ic / Ns Ar pattern
Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.
N defaults to 1.
The pattern is a basic regular expression.
See
.Xr re_format 7
for more information.
.It Ic ?\& Ns Ar pattern
Search backward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern.
.It Ic /! Ns Ar pattern
Like /, but the search is for the N-th line
which does NOT contain the pattern.
.It Ic ?! Ns Ar pattern
Like ?, but the search is for the N-th line
which does NOT contain the pattern.
.It Ic n
Repeat previous search, for N-th line containing the last pattern
(or NOT containing the last pattern,
if the previous search was /! or ?!).
.It Ic N
Repeat previous search in the opposite direction,
for N-th line containing the last pattern
(or NOT containing the last pattern,
if the previous search was /! or ?!).
.It Ic :e Op Ar filename
Examine a new file.
If
.Ar filename
is missing, the "current" file
from the list of files in the command line is re-examined.
.It Ic :n
Examine the next file.
If a number N is specified, the N-th next file is examined.
.It Ic :p
Examine the previous file.
If a number N is specified, the N-th previous file is examined.
.It Ic v
Invokes an editor to edit the current file being viewed.
The editor is taken from the environment variable

.Xr vi 1 .
