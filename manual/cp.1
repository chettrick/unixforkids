.Sh NAME
.Nm cp
.Nd copy files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cp
.Op Fl fi
.Op Fl R
.Ar source target
.Nm cp
.Op Fl fi
.Op Fl R
.Ar source ... directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In the first synopsis form, the
.Nm
utility copies the contents of the
.Ar source
file to the
.Ar target
file.
In the second synopsis form,
the contents of each named
.Ar source
file are copied to the destination
.Ar directory .
The names of the files themselves are not changed.
If
.Nm
detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
For each existing destination pathname, remove it and
create a new file, without prompting for confirmation,
regardless of its permissions.
The
.Fl f
option overrides any previous
.Fl i
options.
.It Fl i
Write a prompt to the standard error output before copying a file
that would overwrite an existing file.
If the response from the standard input begins with the character
.Sq Li y ,
the file copy is attempted.
The
.Fl i
option overrides any previous
.Fl f
options.
.It Fl R
If
.Ar source
designates a directory,
.Nm
copies the directory and the entire subtree connected at that point.
Created directories have the same mode as the corresponding source
directory.
.El
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
the destination specified by the
.Ar directory
operand must exist unless there is only one named
.Ar source
which is a directory and the
.Fl R
flag is specified.
.Pp
Appropriate permissions are required for file creation or overwriting.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std cp
.Sh EXAMPLES
Make a copy of file
.Pa foo
named
.Pa bar :
.Pp
.Dl $ cp foo bar
.Pp
Copy a group of files to the
.Pa /tmp
directory:
.Pp
.Dl $ cp *.txt /tmp
.Pp
